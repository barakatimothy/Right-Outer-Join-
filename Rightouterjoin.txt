A right outer join is a type of join operation used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a specified condition, and it includes all the rows from the right (second) table and matching rows from the left (first) table. 
If there are no matching rows in the left table for a particular row in the right table, the result will still include the row from the right table, but the columns from the left table will contain NULL values.
 
// Syntax 
SELECT columns
FROM right_table
RIGHT JOIN left_table
ON right_table.column = left_table.column;



employee_id | employee_name | department_id
-------------------------------------------
1           | Alice         | 101
2           | Bob           | 102
3           | Carol         | 101



department_id | department_name
-------------------------------
101           | HR
103           | Finance


SELECT employee_name, department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
